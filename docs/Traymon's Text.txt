Network meta-analysis is a method used to generate effect size estimates given study-level summary/contrast measures (sample means/sample mean differences, proportions/log odds ratios, etc.) along with the standard error of these summary/contrast measures (R?cker & Schwarzer, 2015). Using network meta-analysis, results can be generated for all possible treatment arm comparisons using only the study-level information from all available studies; specifically, treatment arm comparisons which were not included in any of the studies (e.g. ASA only vs. PSY12 only) can now be estimated by borrowing information from treatment arm comparisons that were included in at least one of the studies.

Random effects network meta-analysis were used to to0 compare the effects of three types of treatments - aspirin only, P2Y12 only, and their compbination (DARP)
